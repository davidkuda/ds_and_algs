# Algorithms and Data Structures

You find a collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in The Go Programming Language. Most data structures are implemented with generics.

Primarily, I use these two sources:

- __ALGS4:__ [www.algs4.cs.princeton.edu](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/)
- __CCI:__ [www.crackingthecodinginterview.com](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/)
